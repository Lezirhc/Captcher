Captcher will check if the code entered match or generate a new one if it doesn't.\r\n\r\n#Sample\r\nSee the sample [Here](https://rawgit.com/Lezirhc/Captcher/master/Sample/sample.html).\r\n\r\n#How to use\r\n##Embedding the project:\r\n1. Simply embed the Captcher source file in your html page.\r\n\r\n    ```html  \r\n        <script type='text/javascript' src='path-to-Captcher-Source-File.js'></script>\r\n    ```\r\n2. Call the ``` run() ``` function on page load or anytime you want the Captcher to generate a code.\r\n    ```html\r\n        <body onload='run()'>\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n3. Create 2 labels or any sort that will hold the generated code by the Captcher and the result then give it an id named ``` code ``` & ``` result-label ```. Next, Make a textbox that has an id named ```tbCode```. Lastly, Make a button that calls the ```validate()``` function in its ```onClick=\"\"``` event.\r\n      ```html\r\n        <p id='code'></p>\r\n        <input type='text' id='tbCode'>\r\n        <button onclick='validate()'>Submit</button>\r\n        <p id='result-label'></p>\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n##Generating a new code (\"Try new code\" purposes)\r\nTo generate a new code, Simply call the ```run()``` function.\r\n\r\n##Modify code length\r\nTo modify the number of characters of the captcha code, simply edit the value of the variable ```c_myCodeLength``` to the length you want. The default is 6.\r\n\r\n#Note:\r\nThis is just purely javascript made as this is a project in one of my subjects in school. Will use jQuery next time.\r\n\r\n#License\r\nThis work is licensed under [GNU GPL v3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
